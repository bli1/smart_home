Three txt should be in the same file of smartHome.m
	1) price.txt
	number of the price also indicates the timeslot and the electricity price of that timeslot;
	2) runtime.txt runtime_nonschedulable.txt
	3) power.txt power_nonschedulable.txt

	runtime and power indicate number of appliances. Thus the dimension of them must be the same.
